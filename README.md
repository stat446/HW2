# HW2
#### 1. 
_From Lohr Exercise 2.1._ Let N = 6 and n = 3. For purposes of studying sampling distributions, assume that all population value are known.

y<sub>1</sub> = 98, y<sub>2</sub> = 102, y<sub>3</sub> = 154, y<sub>4</sub> = 133, y<sub>5</sub> = 190, y<sub>1</sub> = 175
We are interested in learning the population mean, so two sampling schemes are proposed.

#### a. (4 points)
For each of the possible samples listed below, compute the point estimate from the sample. Note plan one has 8 possible samples and plan 2 has 3 possible samples.

Plan 1. Eight possible samples may be chosen.

1. Sample = {1,3,5}; Probability of selection = 1/8
2. Sample = {1,3,6}; Probability of selection = 1/8
3. Sample = {1,4,5}; Probability of selection = 1/8
4. Sample = {1,4,6}; Probability of selection = 1/8
5. Sample = {2,3,5}; Probability of selection = 1/8
6. Sample = {2,3,6}; Probability of selection = 1/8
7. Sample = {2,4,5}; Probability of selection = 1/8
8. Sample = {2,4,6}; Probability of selection = 1/8

Plan 2. Three possible samples may be chosen

1. Sample = {1,4,6}; Probability of selection = 1/4
2. Sample = {1,3,6}; Probability of selection = 1/2
3. Sample = {1,4,5}; Probability of selection = 1/4


#### b. (3 points)
What are the inclusion probabilities for each of the six units under Plan 1?


#### c. (3 points)
What are the inclusion probabilities for each of the six units under Plan 2?


#### d. (2 points)
What is the value of the population mean 


#### e. (4 points)
For the estimator in plan 1, compute the expectation, variance, bias, and mean-squared error.


#### f. (4 points)
For the estimator in plan 2, compute the expectation, variance, bias, and mean-squared error. 


#### g. (2 points)
Which sampling scheme do you think is better? Justify your answer.


#### 2. (4 points)
Assume you have a one hundred households and choose to implement a systematic sampling scheme. Please write R pseudocode to carry out this procedure.
